- **Rotate tokens**: Regularly update API tokens for security
- **Limit permissions**: Use minimum required permissions for tokens

### Production Safety
Consider disabling dangerous operations in production:
```bash
claude mcp add directus-prod -e DIRECTUS_URL=$PROD_URL -e DIRECTUS_TOKEN=$PROD_TOKEN -e DISABLED_TOOLS="delete_item,delete_collection,delete_user,delete_file" npx @directus/content-mcp@latest
```

- Regular audits of automated content changes

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
```bash
# Test WeExit directly
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $DIRECTUS_TOKEN" $DIRECTUS_URL/server/info

# Check Claude MCP status
claude mcp list
claude mcp test directus
claude mcp logs directus
```

### Permission Errors
- Verify token has required permissions in WeExit Admin
- Check collection-level permissions for content operations
- Ensure user role includes necessary privileges

### Package Issues
```bash
# Reinstall package
npm uninstall -g @directus/content-mcp
npm install -g @directus/content-mcp@latest

# Verify installation
npx @directus/content-mcp@latest --help
```
