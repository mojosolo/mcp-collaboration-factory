Use “So that…” statements.\n- Conditions of Satisfaction (60 min):\n  - Brainstorm candidate objectives.\n  - Convert to SMART with acceptance tests. Example: “Launch MVP to 500 beta users by Nov 30; acceptance: >20% 30-day retention and NPS ≥ 30.”\n  - Prioritize top 3–7; assign owners; define leading indicators.\n- Boundaries/unacceptables (20 min): List constraints (budget, timelines, compliance, quality), and explicit unacceptables (e.g., scope changes without change control; undisclosed risks; missed commitments without advance notice).\n- Decision preview (10 min): Agree the decision-making model (e.g., DACI/consent) to use going forward.\n\nWorkshop Part 2 (2 hours): Who and How We’ll Work\n- Team roles and RACI/DACI (45 min):\n  - Define key domains (Vision, Delivery, Quality, Security, Customer, Operations, Budget, Change Control).\n  - Assign D/A/C/I for each domain. Clarify single Accountable where possible.\n- Team values to behaviors (40 min):\n  - Select 3–5 values from the list (e.g., Accountability, Honesty, Trust, Excellence, Collaboration).\n  - For each, define 2–3 observable behaviors and a measure. Example: Honesty → “Raise red flags within 24h; measure: time-to-escalation median <24h.”\n- Shared standards and working agreement (30 min):\n  - Translate the provided standards into “we will” statements. Examples:\n    - Tell the truth: “We will state facts and assumptions separately; no triangulation; address issues directly within 48h.”\n    - Commitments: “We will not commit without capacity check; if at risk, we inform owner ≥24h before due date and renegotiate.”\n    - Hon",
