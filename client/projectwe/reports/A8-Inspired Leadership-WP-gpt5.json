It’s organized into principles-to-behaviors, a 90‑day plan, leader habits, team operating system, decision/empowerment, conflict handling, listening practices, measurement, templates, and tools.\n\nGuiding principles translated to observable behaviors\n- Walk the talk and act from integrity:\n  - Publish your personal leadership commitments and let the team hold you accountable.\n  - End each week with a “Promises made/promises kept” review.\n- Minimal, high-value intervention:\n  - Ask before telling; coach before directing. Use the “ask–reflect–offer–decide” ladder.\n- Rely on group competence and shared purpose:\n  - Co-create a clear purpose, outcomes, and decision rights; rotate facilitation and ownership.\n- Simple, honest communication:\n  - Use plain language updates: what we know, don’t know, and how we’ll decide.\n- Service to the whole:\n  - Allocate time to remove team impediments; celebrate others’ wins; give credit publicly.\n- Presence and awareness:\n  - Build daily practices for focus and listening; run regular retros on your own leadership.\n\n90-day rollout plan\nPhase 1: Listen and assess (Weeks 1–2)\n- Do a listening tour (10–15 stakeholders: team, peers, customers).\n  - Ask: What’s working? What’s hard? Where do I help/hinder? What outcomes matter most in 90 days?\n- Run two short pulses:\n  - Psychological Safety pulse (5–7 Qs, Likert 1–",
