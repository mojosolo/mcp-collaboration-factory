For each, capture:\n  - Opportunities created\n  - Concerns/risks\n- Step 2: Identify prerequisites to enable a confident decision:\n  - Information to gather, approvals needed, budget, resources, timing, legal/compliance checks\n- Step 3: Draft future scenarios for each option:\n  - Best case, most likely, worst case; expected outcomes and indicators\n- Step 4: Document personal learning considerations:\n  - Skills/knowledge to acquire, advisors/mentors needed, training plans\n- Step 5: Build an alternatives overview:\n  - For each option: impact on self/family/business, key challenges, items to address\n  - Note overall considerations that cut across all options\n- Conclude: Rank options using your chosen criteria, define next actions, owners, and timelines to close gaps, then decide or set a decision date\n\nGaps and clarifications to resolve\n- Define explicit scoring criteria and weights (impact vs feasibility vs risk)\n- Establish decision deadline and decision owner(s)\n- Specify stakeholders beyond “me, my family, business” if applicable\n- Add a risk/mitigation log and an assumptions list\n- Determine evidence required to move from assessment to commitment (e.g., pilots, experiments)\n\nDeliverables produced by applying the framework\n- Option-by-option assessment sheets (opportunities, concerns)\n- Prerequisites checklist with status\n- Scenario summaries per option\n- Learning plan for the decision-maker\n- Alternatives overview",

It provides concrete steps, roles, tools, templates, and facilitation tips for both solo and team use.\n\nQuick-start overview\n- Clarify the decision: Write a one-sentence decision statement and a by-when date.\n- Classify the decision:\n  - Two-way door (reversible, low cost to change): Bias to action; use the “standard” process.\n  - One-way door (irreversible or costly): Use the “deep” process and involve stakeholders.\n- Prepare options: Start with X and Y; add at least one alternative or a hybrid.\n- Define criteria: Identify must-haves (pass/fail) and should-haves (weighted).\n- Collect data: Identify what facts you need; timebox research.\n- Build a decision matrix and run a pre-mortem before deciding.\n- Decide, document, and communicate. Set a review date and triggers to revisit.\n\nRoles and governance\n- Decision owner/Decider: Accountable for the final call.\n- Contributors/Advisers: Provide input, data, and challenge assumptions.\n- Approvers (if required): Legal, compliance, finance.\n- Informed stakeholders: People impacted; communicate after decision.\n- Use DACI or RAPID if helpful (Driver/Decider/Approver/Contributors/Informed).\n\nCadences and timeboxes\n",

What is the cost of delay? What options decay over time?\n- Decision rights: Who decides, who is consulted, who is informed? What is the time-bound?\n- Success criteria: Define must-haves, nice-to-haves, guardrails, and “good enough” thresholds.\n- Value of more info: What data would change the decision? Is waiting worth it (EVPI logic)?\n\n1) Expand and assess options (design the decision, don’t just select)\n- Generate non-obvious options: status quo, partial, staged, partner/outsourcing, licensing, platform/ecosystem play, sequencing, geographic wedge, “do the opposite,” and “pre-commit and signal.”\n- For each option X, Y, etc.:\n  - Impact: On you/family, team, customers, business model, brand, environment.\n  - Confidence: Base rates, reference class, prior experience.\n  - Reversibility and regret: If wrong, how bad and how long?\n  - Option value and learning: What does this teach cheaply?
