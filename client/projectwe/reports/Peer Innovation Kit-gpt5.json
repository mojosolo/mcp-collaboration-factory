Identifying core issue\n- 2. Defining problem statement\n- 3. Generating new possibilities\n- 4. Testing/Prototyping\n- 5. Learning\n- 6. Declaring future state\n\nMeeting breakdown and steps\n\nMeeting #1 – Defining Problem Statement\n- Step 1: Identify the core issue\n  - Explore obstacles, challenges, and current reality\n  - Use a beginner’s mindset to probe what/how/why\n  - Use stories/analogies to surface issues\n  - Apply “5 Whys” to reach root cause/concern\n- Step 2: Define the problem statement\n  - Synthesize information from Step 1\n  - Align on the specific challenge and target/endgame\n  - Craft an actionable “How might we…” statement that:\n    - Narrows focus\n    - Inspires the team\n    - Supports innovation\n    - Engages stakeholders\n    - Is actionable, insightful, and valid\n- Step 3: Homework\n  - Generate candidate problem statements for next meeting\n\nMeeting #2 – Generating New Possibilities\n- Step 1: Ideate\n  - Gather ideas\n  - Share assessments\n  - Identify key assessments to explore\n  - Ground assessments in:\n    - Concern for the future\n    - Domain (specificity)\n    - Supporting assertions\n    - Shared standards\n  - Ask questions to uncover underlying concerns, not just issues\n- Step 2: Design a prototype/test/experiment\n  - Select appropriate audience\n  - Define the right questions\n  - Adapt during testing\n  - Invite user contributions\n  - Iterate\n- Step 3: Define roles, responsibilities, and desired outcomes for the prototype\n  - Leader\n  - Participants\n  - Measurements\n  - Reporting\n  - Data gathering\n  - Requests/Promises for the prototype\n  - Note: Use the Conversation for Results model to set clear Conditions of Satisfaction\n\nMeeting #3 – Interpret, Learn, Declare\n- Step 1: Gather data/input/assessments from the prototype\n  - What worked to keep?\n  - What’s in the way (limiters)?\n  - What do we need to shift or create?\n- Step 2: Decide on additional testing if needed\n- Step 3: Declare Future State (Declaration)\n  - Definition: Statement by someone with authority that defines a future state; changes the world from the moment it’s spoken.\n  - Criteria:\n    - Clearly communicates the intended future\n    - Provides compelling reasons to reach it\n    - Engages and energizes\n    - Includes clear Conditions of Satisfaction\n    - Leads to effective requests\n  - If commitment exists to proceed: see Project Launch Kit\n\nRoles and stakeholders\n- Leader: Holds authority to declare; sets Conditions of Satisfaction; makes requests; coordinates prototype roles.\n- Participants (team members): Ideate, test, gather/report data, contribute assessments.\n- Users/Test audience: Provide feedback and ideas during prototyping.\n- Stakeholders: Must be engaged by the problem statement and declaration; recipients of compelling reasons and requests.\n\nKey concepts and tools\n- Beginner’s mindset: Approach with curiosity; question assumptions.\n- 5 Whys: Root-cause inquiry technique.\n- Stories/analogies: Reveal underlying issues.\n- Assessments vs. assertions:\n  - Ground assessments in future concerns, domain specificity, supporting assertions, and shared standards.\n- Prototyping principles: Right audience, right questions, adapt, co-create with users, iterate.\n- Conversation for Results model: Used to define Conditions of Satisfaction and structure requests/promises.\n- Conditions of Satisfaction: Clear, testable criteria for success in testing and declarations.\n- Declarations: Authority-based future-state commitments that mobilize action.\n\nDeliverables",

      "content": "Here’s a concise, business-focused analysis of the strategic patterns and implications embedded in the Peer Innovation kit.\n\nStrategic themes\n- Problem-first, hypothesis-driven innovation: Root-cause discovery (5 Whys) + “How might we” reframing anchors work on real constraints and opportunities.\n- Fast learning loops: Ideate → prototype/test → learn → declare. This compresses time-to-insight and reduces waste.\n- Conversational governance: Requests/promises, Conditions of Satisfaction, and Declarations convert talk into accountable commitments.\n- Stakeholder co-creation: Explicitly involves users and cross-functional teams, improving adoption and reducing change friction.\n- Decision rights clarity: “Declaration” introduces authority and accountability for setting a future state (avoids endless consensus).\n- Evidence-based prioritization: Grounding assessments (concern/domain/assertions/standards) reduces bias and increases repeatability.\n\nCompetitive advantages (for organizations that adopt this)\n- Speed of learning and execution: Shorten cycle from problem identification to validated solution, enabling faster pivots than competitors.\n- Higher innovation hit rate: Prototypes and explicit Conditions of Satisfaction improve fit and reduce false positives.\n- Alignment at scale: Declarations + Conversation for Results create shared understanding and measurable commitments across silos.\n- Reduced coordination costs: Requests/promises mechanism clarifies dependencies and timelines, lowering rework and delays.\n- Cultural edge: Establishes norms of psychological safety, rigorous thinking, and shared standards—hard for competitors to replicate quickly.\n\nMarket opportunities\n- Verticals with complex stakeholders and high compliance or risk: Healthcare, financial services, government, enterprise IT, logistics.\n- Use cases: Strategy refresh, CX redesign, operational excellence, product discovery, transformation programs, M&A integration, R&D portfolio management.\n- Buyer personas: Heads of Strategy/Innovation, PMO, COO/Transformation leads, HR/L&D (for embedding as a capability), BU leaders.\n\nBusiness model insights (if productizing/commercializing the kit)\n- Positioning: “Innovation Operating System” that unifies discovery, decision rights, and execution discipline.\n- Offer structure:\n  - SaaS workflow: Track problem statements, HMWs, experiments, requests/promises, Conditions of Satisfaction, and Declarations. Integrate with Slack, Jira, Miro, Notion.\n  - Services: Facilitation for the three-meeting cadence; leadership coaching on declarations; certification for internal facilitators.\n  - Content/IP: Playbooks, templates, case libraries, industry-specific modules.\n  - AI copilot: Idea clustering, hypothesis generation, test design, KPI instrumentation, sentiment analysis from user tests.\n- Pricing and GTM:\n  - Land-and-expand: 6–8 week pilots with 3–5 teams, outcome-based case studies, then enterprise rollout.\n  - Pricing: Pilot facilitation ($25–75k); SaaS ($12–30/user/month + per-team run fee); certification ($1–3k per seat); enterprise license for unlimited teams.\n- Data moat:\n  - Benchmarks on cycle time to declaration, prototype success rates, promise reliability, and CoS attainment by industry.\n  - Pattern libraries of successful “How might we” frames and Declarations.\n\nOperating model implications\n- Portfolio cadence: Run the kit as a quarterly discovery ritual; feed validated bets into delivery/OKRs.\n- Decision governance: Define who can issue Declarations at which scope; tie them to funding and CoS.\n- Capability building: Train facilitators, coaches, and leaders in requests/promises, assessments/assertions, and Declarations.\n\nKey metrics to manage\n- Throughput and speed: Time from problem statement → prototype → declaration; number of cycles per quarter.\n-",

Its power lies less in ideation and more in changing how a team uses language to create reality.\n\nLong-term implications (capabilities you’ll build if you institutionalize it)\n- Faster sensemaking cycles: Teams learn to compress the time from “signal” → “experiment” → “decision,” compounding organizational learning.\n- Trust and reliability as assets: Clear requests/promises with Conditions of Satisfaction convert good intentions into dependable delivery, building institutional credibility.\n- Antifragility: Safe-to-fail prototypes repeatedly expose weak assumptions; failure becomes feedstock for smarter bets.\n- Portfolio discipline: Regularized cycles increase the throughput and quality of decisions, enabling a balanced portfolio (near-term fixes plus longer-horizon bets).\n- Language precision as infrastructure: Distinguishing assessments from assertions, and deploying declarations properly, reduces rework and politics over time.\n\nHidden patterns (what usually blocks progress and how the kit addresses it)\n- Solution-jumping: Teams jump to “what to build.” The 5 Whys and “How might we…” reframing re-anchor on the job-to-be-d",
