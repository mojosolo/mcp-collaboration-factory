outside-designed vs co-created.\n- Assessments: Low-awareness, imposed vs life-relevant, choice-enhancing.\n- Rewards: External rewards vs inspiration/internal motivation.\n- Population focus: Active minority vs broader, support-seeking majority.\n\nExtracted entities\n- Activ8 (initiative)\n- Employee Engagement\n- Health and Safety\n- Holistic Risk Management\n- Productivity\n- Assessments\n- Programming\n- Population/Employees\n\nCurrent state (as-is)\n- Motivation: Extrinsic; short-term programming.\n- Behavior change: Low levels of change.\n- Culture: Apathy, resentment, cynicism.\n- Safety/Wellbeing: Health and Safety is siloed.\n- Assessments: Done to them; yields low new awareness.\n- Programming: Designed and delivered by outside support; relies on external rewards.\n- Population reach: Engages ~20% (those already doing something).\n\nFuture state (to-be)\n- Motivation: Intrinsic; internal motivation and inspiration.\n- Behavior change: High engagement; ongoing change sustained by practices.\n- Culture: Caring and accountability; highly engaged; ambitious.\n- Safety/Wellbeing: Holistic risk management and productivity solution.\n- Assessments: Done for them; relevant to personal life; increases awareness and choice.\n- Programming: Outside support remains but co-created design and delivery with employees.\n- Population reach: Engages ~60% (those seeking support).\n\nKey metrics and targets\n- Engagement coverage: Current 20% (already active) → Target 60% (support-seeking cohort).\n- Behavior change durability: From short-term to ongoing/sustained (define persistence windows, e.g., 6–12 months).\n- Cultural sentiment: From negative (apathy/cynicism) to positive (caring/accountability), measured via pulse surveys.\n- Integration: From siloed H&S to integrated holistic risk/productivity outcomes.\n\nStakeholders\n- Employees (including the 20% already active and the 60% seeking support)\n- People managers and team leads\n- Health and Safety\n- HR/People/DEI\n- Executive leadership\n- External partners/vendors\n- Program designers/facilitators\n- Data/Analytics\n\nGaps and challenges\n- Overreliance on extrinsic incentives driving short-lived engagement.\n- Siloed H&S limits holistic impact.\n- Assessments feel imposed; low relevance and awareness creation.\n- Programming not co-created; low ownership/agency.\n- Limited reach beyond already-engaged 20%; missing majority who need support.\n\nActionable insights and recommendations\n1) Reframe objectives and audiences\n- Segment employees into cohorts (already active, support-seeking, ambivalent) and design tailored journeys to move 60%+ into active engagement.\n- Define explicit behavior outcomes (e.g., safety practices, wellbeing routines, productivity habits).\n\n2) Shift from extrinsic to intrinsic motivators\n- Reduce reliance on transactional rewards; introduce recognition, autonomy, mastery, purpose.\n- Build routines and social norms (peer groups, communities of practice) to sustain habits.\n\n3) Co-create the program\n- Establish an employee design council and run co-design workshops.\n- Pilot co-created interventions in diverse teams; iterate quickly.\n\n4) Redesign assessments\n- Make assessments voluntary, brief, and personally useful; provide immediate, life-relevant insights and choices.\n- Include reflective prompts and personalized recommendations tied to work and home contexts.\n\n5) Integrate H&S with holistic risk and productivity\n- Create a unified roadmap spanning safety, wellbeing, workload, and performance.\n- Align governance and reporting across H&S, HR, and Operations.\n\n6) Experience and delivery model\n- Maintain external expertise but embed internal champions; train managers as facilitators.\n- Replace one-off events with sequenced nudges, micro-learning, and practice labs.\n\n7) Measurement and learning\n- Set baseline metrics; track engagement breadth, habit adoption, and cultural sentiment.\n- Use rapid A/B testing and quarterly review cycles to refine.\n\nProposed KPIs\n- Engagement reach: % of employees participating monthly; target ≥60%.\n- Habit persistence: % maintaining behaviors at 3, 6, 12 months.\n- Psychological safety and sentiment: Pulse survey indices (e.g., caring, accountability).\n- Safety outcomes: Incident and near-miss rates; proactive reporting volume.\n- Productivity: Team throughput/quality metrics where applicable.\n- Participation quality: Completion of assessments and follow-through on recommended actions.\n- Manager enablement: % of managers trained and actively coaching.\n\nRisks and mitigations\n- Change fatigue/cynicism: Co-create and communicate value; show quick wins.\n- Over-simpl",
